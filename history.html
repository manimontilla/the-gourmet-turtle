		<h3>Our Legacy</h3>
		<p>The year was 1895. A group of adventurous Englishmen searched the seas for a route to China. What they found instead was a quaint country called Singapore. 
Upon their arrival, they were enthralled with the local culture. Of all of the unique cuisine, what captured them most was the “Sup Penyu.” 
In Singapore, the snapping turtle is considered a rare delicacy.
Eager to share their discovery the men recorded everything they saw, including recipes, local customs, and geography. Eventually, they grew homesick and decided to return to their native land. 
On their way back to England, all but one of the men perished on the boat, El Tortuga. </p>
<p>William Richard Jr., the last of the crew and a mere deckhand, decided to share with the world the wonders of SIngapore.
 Unfortunately, no one believed him. The only thing that survived the journey where notebooks filled with recipes. 
 William dreamed of starting his own restaurant with these notebooks, but he was too poor.
</p>
<p>William eventually perished in 1921 alone in a brothel. 
The notebooks were passed on from generation to generation until finally his great-great nephew pawned the books of to an eccentric millionaire. 
This man, Dr. Richie Mula, started a small restaurant on the coast of California named The Gourmet Turtle. 
Locals and tourists alike praised the innovative dishes. It became a local legend. In 2006, Gourmet Turtles entered the list of 3-star Michelin restaurants.</p>
<p>Today we continue to serve the ancient recipes of Singapore to our satisfied customers.</p>
